# Description
# ===========
#
# Pre-deploy hook. Does the following:
#   1. Shows the commits about to be pushed
#   2. Ask for confirmation (exit with 1 if not confirming)
#   3. Notify Slack
#
#
# Developing
# ==========
# 
# During development, the best way to test it is to call the script
# directly with `./scripts/pre-deploy.sh staging|production`. You can also set
# the `SLACK_CHANNEL` to your personnal channel so you don't flood the team.
# To do that, right click on your own name in Slack, `Copy link`, then
# only keep the last part of the URL.
#
# Or you can set `PUSH_TO_SLACK` to false to echo the payload instead of
# sending it.
#
